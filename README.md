## Missing features & future developments

- Should be made mobile friendly
- Online multiplayer mode should be added: I write a piece, you write a piece, the AI writes a piece.
- Share button for letting other people read your story
- Other kinds of stories should be made available instead of always the same one
- OpenAI Whisper could be used for not having to type
- Some text-to-speech model could be used for not having to read (and making the experience more immersive)
- DALL-E could be used for dynamically generating the background image based on what's happening in the story
- The background music could be dynamically generated based on what's happening in the story
- Automatic video generation based on the story, when the technology appears (AI filmmaking). This will be cool.
